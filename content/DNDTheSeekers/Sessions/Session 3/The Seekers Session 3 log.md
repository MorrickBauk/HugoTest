	- Taboo lets Larabonkaorochimaruvoldemortnagini Junior eat a drop, it likes it and stars getting more
	- Taboo then procedess to do the same, and just keep catching the drops into her mouth
	- Party is confused and takes a few steps back towards the lava pool
	- Taboo wants more and more of the liquid, AAron trying to figure out as much about it as possible, pressdigitates Taboos next bite to taste and smell like horse shit
	- Taboo throws a drop at him, he dodges
	- Taboo eats her drop and wants more, the two repeat the whole horseshit and dodging act

	- party decides to go back to the crystal cave to rest
	- drops taboo ate stopped dripping, AAron tries to shoot the source on the ceiling but misses and almost hits ChungaLunga Jr

	- AAron tells everyone to calm down, shut up and just follow him
	- Most of the group isn't really trusting AAron because he got well with the random necro dude who had a monologu about making Vidar burn with his returned sentry army
	- The Seekers agree to follow AAron when he show that Necro drew them a map of the rest of the cave and how to exit out
